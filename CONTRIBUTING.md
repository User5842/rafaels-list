Is there a good question I missed? Do you want to change the way the site looks? Is there a weird bug surfacing on your device?

Let me know!

I'm pretty lax on PRs; the repo is small, so there's not too much at stake ðŸ™‚

If you _do_ end up suggesting a question, I could see myself making videos for user-submitted questions ðŸ¤”
