# Rafael's List

## What is this?

I gave myself a crazy goal of live-streaming _every single_ LeetCode question. You read that, _every single_ question.

I started on r/pan over at Reddit, then evolved to YouTube, and am now doing multi-streaming on both YouTube and Twitch.

It has been _a lot_ of fun. I have learned much from this exercise and have enjoyed getting into the streaming universe.

## How does this help me?

Consider me your virtual study buddy. If you want to study with someone or watch someone make mistakes, struggle, and hopefully develop an optimized algorithm; you've landed at the right place.

You should **[start here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWzGjDEgHSJrDEUbJxp1J9KFyYg4G4l9Y)** with the first video in my LeetCode live playlist. Each video has chapters for easy navigation and links to the questions covered.

You can watch the video and do the questions alongside me or do the questions first and then watch the video.

## Okay, but what is this repo for?

I created another LeetCode list called **[Rafael Negron's List](https://leetcode.com/list/e0cifw95)**. I wanted a way to link all of these questions to the streams where they are shown.
