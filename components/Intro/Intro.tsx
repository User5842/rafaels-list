        streaming myself doing every single question on LeetCode
      </a>
      . Each question links to a part in a stream where I talk about the
      problem. My intent is not to necessarily teach you how to solve these
      questions (there are plenty of resources for that), but rather, to give
      you a raw look into my thought process. You&apos;ll watch me make
      mistakes, hear me struggle and hopefully develop an optimized algorithm by
      the end.
